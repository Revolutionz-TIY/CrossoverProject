##Revolutionz - How much is ***time*** worth to you?



####What is Revolutionz?
Have you ever woken up and wished you had more time to get your assignment done, had just a few more days to finish something at work, or even had a few more hours just to spend with you family? We've all had those moments that we hoped never ended. Well now you can do something about it!


####So, what does it _really_ do?
This is a crossover project given to the Front and Back End classes (first of it's kind at The Iron Yard - Minneapolis!) where we create our own API, products and design while collaborating together to build a fun, functional and clean experience for our clients. We've created a mobile-first design that compliments our beautiful API based around the concept of **time**. We have 3 url calls directing the client to different places on the page, including "MyWatch", which is a profile page. 

The client can add, remove and check out of the cart, with icons showing the success and error when an item is added.


####Time? What do you mean time?
It may not be a physical object that a person could go out to stores and buy (typically), but what is more important and valuable than time? We offer an opportunity to do just that.





####Comments? Questions? Ideas? Let us know!
We believe in open-source and building on ideas. If you have any ideas of improvement, comments on design or build, please let us know!
